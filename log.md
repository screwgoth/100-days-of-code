##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Commited some changes to the rasbot project. Also started with FreeCodeCamp FrontEnd Development on HTML.

**Thoughts** Need to spend some more time on rasbot installation. Most of the stuff HTML on FCC was already known.
